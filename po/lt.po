"(Journal entry of the Insane Hermit) -I have reached success with this small "
"experiment on creating a commandable form of arcane energy. It seems more "
"like a living slush than ice, despite the fact that it seems to hold a core "
"temperature far below freezing. These are excellent at navigating terrain, "
"but not with the superior combat abilities I was hoping for. These "
"embodiments seem to be immune to their own energy and very resistant to "
"other forms of magic. I would have preferred that they were more resistant "
"to mundane weapons, given that these creations aren't very resilient. I just "
"hope these will help defend my land."
